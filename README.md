Howdy y'all, it's Diz! I'm the founder and COO of StellarDev, a software development company that creates unique and optimized premade and exclusive projects for the Minecraft community. My passion is to help others see the potential in themselves and unlock it to create their own wealth. I am very focused, detail oriented, and adaptable. I use this to overcome the unique challenges I face as a business owner in the Minecraft space. My goal with StellarDev is to open as many eyes and change as many lives as possible through a game we all grew up enjoying.Â

Hi! I'm MTM123. Programming is my hobby that started out with making plugins for minecraft servers and it expanded way beyond that. I'm the most experience with Java. I have experience with Kotlin and Python and some web development experience (PHP, Angular, JS).
