Howdy y'all, it's Diz! I'm the founder and COO of StellarDev, a software development company that creates unique and optimized premade and exclusive projects for the Minecraft community. My passion is to help others see the potential in themselves and unlock it to create their own wealth. I am very focused, detail oriented, and adaptable. I use this to overcome the unique challenges I face as a business owner in the Minecraft space. My goal with StellarDev is to open as many eyes and change as many lives as possible through a game we all grew up enjoying.

Hey, I’m Jacob. I’m one of the founders and lead developers at StellarDev. Since 2017 I’ve been leading development on our optimized spigot forks and working to create highly optimized and efficient solutions for servers of all sizes. Part of StellarDev’s goal is to create opportunities for others, so I'm always working hard to create new breakthroughs so we can continue to provide industry leading products for our customers.

Hi! I'm MTM123. Programming is my hobby that started out with making plugins for minecraft servers and it expanded way beyond that. I have the most experience with Java. I have experience with Kotlin and Python and some web development experience (PHP, Angular, JS).

Yo, I'm Ignite (https://github.com/IM-IgniteDEV), a 19-year-old passionate programmer familiar with most technologies used in current server development. I've been coding in Java since I was 12, and I started that journey in Minecraft development. I'm powered by weed, but the most important thing to me is quality. I cannot work on projects that need to be rushed; it is not for me. I always do everything in the most efficient way and I focus on quality. I'm experienced in many languages, however, I'm taking only commissions in Java since it's my love.

Hey, I'm repeater64, a Minecraft plugin developer with a passion for the game and multiple years of experience. I love constantly learning and being able to look back on how much I've improved, and also enjoy helping people out wherever I can. I'm proficient in Java and love writing the cleanest code I can! My goal is to make a name for myself as a friendly and helpful developer and to have a positive impact on as many Minecraft servers out there as possible.

Hello! I'm Elapsed, I'm 19 years old and going into network engineering. I've been coding Java for about 2 years now and am slowly getting into system administration. My main thing is to make everything automated in my life, such as one of my repositories, HomeDetection or FileOrg. (https://github.com/ElapsedDev). My main goal in development is to make everything efficient and optimized! Also, I'm weird.

Hey, I'm Ember. I've been working with StellarDev since it's creation and been working with Diz for many years. I've been developing in Java since high school, and more recently in JavaScript (TypeScript), Python, and PHP. Minecraft has always had a special place in my heart because of the friends I've made and the amount of time I've spent playing.

Hey, I'm Bart and I'm 20 years Java developer. I work with the language since 2015, worked with various databases and technologies over that time. When it comes to spigot servers, I mostly care about performance to keep the code stable and fast.

Hi, I'm Shev. I'm 26 years old, and i started programming in when i was 15. My very first language was C, but in 2012 i stumbled upon minecraft and bukkit, and decided to dive into plugin development. My first public plugins were AutoSaveWorld(a recode of AutoSave) and ChairsReloaded(a recode of Chairs), and they are still used by many servers. Since that time i have written many more plugins and improved my code quality a lot.  Apart from bukkit i also have knowledge in Spring, so i can do web development too. I prefer quality over quantity, so i'm always ensuring that my code is as clean as possible, but if absolutely needed, i can always throw a bunch of duct tape at thing that needs an urgent fix.
